                <li>Each round, a random person will be selected to choose a word for the rest of the group.</li>
                <li>Everyone else will try to guess their word.</li>
                <li>The Chooser earns points for every incorrect guess.</li>
                <li>Guessers earn points when they guess the word. The fewer tries it takes, the more points are earned.</li>
